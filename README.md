# Boilerplate To The Knee
Choice game engine

While learning JavaScript I created a very minimalistic Choice Game Engine.

It's done in pure JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS and has a damn small code base. It's done without fancy frameworks like JQuery.

## Features

* Of course you can write multiple choice games with it.
* The game content is also written in JavaScript using simple commands. Why choose a boring interpreter syntax?! ;-)
* Gamestate is persisted using the [HTML 5 local storage](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_webstorage.asp) feature.
* Status popup to track the players stats.
